And I never told him so.","<b>Leela</b>: You can't go to Omega 3. It's forbidden. I forbid you.<br><b>Fry</b>: But we have to. The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future.<br><b>Leela</b>: But it's set 800 years in the past.<br><b>Bender</b>: Yeah, why is it so important you?<br><b>Fry</b>: Because it... it taught me so much.

It's all so simple!","<b>Bender</b>: Uh, can people who hate \"Star Trek\" leave?<br><b>Walter Koenig</b>: Good question!<br><b>Melllvar</b>: No, they have to stay even longer.","My story is a lot like yours, only more interesting 'cause it involves robots.","<b>Bender</b>: Fleeing somewhere?<br><b>Fry</b>: With you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly.","If it's chicken, chicken à la king. If it's fish, fish à la king. If it's turkey, fish à la king.","Hey, whose been messing with my radio? This is not alternative rock, it's college rock.","Let's commence preparations for rumbling!","Congratulations, Fry! You snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she probably has got other characteristics...","<b>Leela</b>: Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?<br><b>Bender</b>: Because he's a loser, that's why.

Ha ha ha, that's funny.","<b>Fry</b>: You look different. Did you get a haircut?<br><b>Bender</b>: No! I sold my body.<br><b>Farnsworth</b>: Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great, but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewelry and skintight pants.","<b>Bender</b>: Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine.

Try some zinc.<br><b>Bender</b>: I'm 40% zinc!<br><b>Amy</b>: Then take some echinacea, or St. John's Wort.<br><b>Farnsworth</b>: Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap!","<b>Dean Vernon</b>: You robots are a disgrace to this university! Whenever a fire alarm is pulled, Robot House! Whenever the campus liquor store is looted, Robot House! Whenever a human corpse is desecrated...<br><b>Bender</b>: Now I can explain that!","<b>Countess de LaRoca</b>: Bender, you risked your life to save me!<br><b>Bender</b>: And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.","<b>Leela</b>: That was the worst delivery ever.<br><b>Fry</b>: Yeah, I'm never going to another planet called Cannibalon.<br><b>Bender</b>: Me neither! Food was good, though.","<b>Farnsworth</b>: Good news, everyone!<br><b>Bender</b>: Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.<br><b>Farnsworth</b>: You'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol.<br><b>Bender</b>: Here it comes.<br><b>Farnsworth</b>: A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.<br><b>Bender</b>: Thank you and goodnight.<br><b>Leela</b>: Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?<br><b>Farnsworth</b>: Why, of course! It's just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone of No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy of Terror!","<b>Bender</b>: There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.<br><b>Zoidberg</b>: Uh-oh! I shouldn't have had seconds","In the name of all that is good and logical, we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic: one zero zero zero one zero one zero one zero one zero one... zero one zero one one zero zero one... two.
